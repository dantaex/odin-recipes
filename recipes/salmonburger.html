        <p>Ingredients</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb of skinless salmon fillet</li>
            <li>brioche buns</li>
            <li>1 shallot</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 lemon</li>
            <li>1 bunch of dill</li>
            <li>2 tbsp mayonnaise</li>
            <li>1-5 cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>3 oz Panko breadcrumbs</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Cooking Instructions</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Pat salmon dry. Place on a microwave-safe plate; cover with plastic wrap. Microwave until salmon is barely opaque and just able to flake, 1â€“3 minutes (check every 15 seconds after 1 minute as microwaves vary). Remove and discard skin; refrigerate while prepping remaining ingredients.</li>
            <li>Wash and chop half the shallot and all of the dill. Reserve other half of shallot for own use.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine 1 tbsp mayonnaise, breadcrumbs, lemon zest, egg, shallot, 90% of the dill, and as much garlic as desired. Flake the salmon into the bowl and combine gently. Using wet hands, divide the mixture into burger shapes.</li>
            <li>In a nonstick pan, add olive oil and cook burgers about 3-4 minutes per side.</li>
            <li>While the burgers are cooking, mix remaining mayonnaise, dill, and garlic together. Add a dash of olive oil and lemon.</li>
            <li>If desired, toast buns and serve salmon burgers with garlic aoili.</li>
        </ol>
